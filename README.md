TASK 2 :- NUMBER GUESSING GAME

Here the idea behind  is to create an number guessing game  that allows a user to guess the number generated by a system.
I have made some changes in code done by using binary search algorithm to run and prints to the console screen upto how many trials user enters, If the user has reached the linit of trials it prints you have all exhaustive trials this is the whole logic behind running this program.

This project must have the capacity to perform these functionalities 
steps:-
1) System generates a random number from 1 to 10.
2) User has to enter a prompt to a given number displayed in a dialog box
3) Entered number matches the guessed number if the number is higher or lower than the generated number.

 NOTE:- number of attempts -> more rounds -> displaying score -> giving points on number of attempts.
