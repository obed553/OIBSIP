TASK 2 :- NUMBER GUESSING GAME

Here the idea behind  is to create an number guessing game  that allows a user to guess the number generated by a system.

This project must have the capacity to perform these functionalities 
steps:-
1) System generates a random number from 1 to 10.
2) User has to enter a prompt to a given number displayed in a dialog box
3) Entered number matches the guessed number if the number is higher or lower than the generated number.

 NOTE:- number of attempts -> more rounds -> displaying score -> giving points on number of attempts.
